## Installation

> Instead of adding the source files directly to your project, you may want to consider using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to manage your dependencies. Follow the instructions on the CocoaPods site to install the gem, and specify `MagicCarpetView` as a dependency in your `Podfile` with

```ruby
pod 'MagicCarpetView', '~> 0.0.1'
```

But if you want to do it the old fashioned way, just add `MagicCarpetView.h/m` files to your project.
